## Comparing Predictive Techniques in AI Using PGA Golf Data: Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, and Multilayered Neural Network 
### Spring 2019 Artificial Intelligence Neural Network Semester Project - PGA Top-Tens 

This project attempts to predict proportion of top-ten placement at PGA tournaments using data of 195 professional golfer from the year 2017
The input features used to build the models are Average Distance Drived, and Experience Measure(number of rounds played in the year*whole number age), and an Accuracy Measure(to hold in 2 shots*percentage of fairways hit).
A basic linear regression model and a more sophisticated linear neural network are used and compared to analyze predictive quality.
